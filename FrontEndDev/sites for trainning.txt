the site: https://www.frontendmentor.io/
It has chalenges for you to choose and take, that are some that are payed and
others that aren't.
So, you can see another person's code, comment it, retrieve some feedback and 
the same the another person can do with yours.
It's great to have ideas and things to train, learn and observe.
I've started a project named "Insure leading page" and I just need to study 
a little bit more about JS so then I get back to complete more things for my portfolio.
