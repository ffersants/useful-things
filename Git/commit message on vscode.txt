Setting a git commit VSCode suddenly opens with this 
"Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary".
You type the message, press enter and still nothing happens?? 
Here's what you have to do:
1 - press "i" (i for insert)
2 - write your merge message
3 - press "esc" (escape)
4 - write ":wq" (write & quit)
5 - then press enter
